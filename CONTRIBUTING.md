Have a few links you want to see on this list?

 * The **syntax** for links is ``[Name](http://homepage.tld/) - Short description.  ``. All links should have main language listed if it isn't English, and should have a description at most 250 characters long.
 * Adding links to this list: Edit README.md directly
 * **Categories** should have at least 3 links before adding a new category.
 * If you don't have an GitHub account and want to have a link or links added contact me via email: SittingDucksModels[over_at]gmail.com
